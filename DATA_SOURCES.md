- [ ] Add CDC Food Environment data
- [ ] Implement data validation and error handling

### Phase 2: Commercial Data
- [ ] Google Places API for store verification
- [ ] Retailer APIs for real-time store data
- [ ] Payment processing for API usage
- [ ] Rate limiting and caching

### Phase 3: Data Quality
- [ ] Data freshness indicators
- [ ] Source attribution for each data point
- [ ] Confidence scores for data accuracy
- [ ] Regular data validation workflows

### Phase 4: International Data
- [ ] Rwanda Ministry of Agriculture API
- [ ] FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) data

## Data Ethics & Privacy

### Considerations
- User location privacy
- Data accuracy disclaimers
- Source attribution requirements
- Update frequency transparency
- Limitation disclosures

### Legal Requirements
- Data licensing compliance
- API terms of service adherence
- Privacy policy updates
- User consent for location data

## Recommended Implementation Timeline

**Week 1-2**: Government data integration (USDA, Census)
**Week 3-4**: Commercial API setup (Google Places, major retailers)
**Week 5-6**: Data validation and quality assurance
**Week 7-8**: User interface updates with credibility indicators
**Week 9-10**: Testing and performance optimization

## Budget Considerations

### API Costs (Monthly Estimates)
- Google Places API: $200-500/month (depending on usage)
- Commercial retailer APIs: $0-300/month
- Government APIs: Free
- Data storage/processing: $50-200/month

**Total Estimated Monthly Cost**: $250-1000/month for production-grade data
