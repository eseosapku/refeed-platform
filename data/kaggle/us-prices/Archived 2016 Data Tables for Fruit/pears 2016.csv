"1The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) reports that inedible stem, core, and seeds account for 10 percent of the retail weight, implying a preparation yield of 90 percent, when eaten raw.",,,,,,

2Consumers are assumed to eat the solid fruit and drink the juice. All contents of the can are edible and count towards an individual's recommended fruit consumption.   ,,,,,,

"3The syrup (or water) is discarded prior to consumption. Based on the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), ERS assumes that 65 percent of the can's gross weight is solid and 35 percent is liquid. The FPED cup equivalent weight for canned fruit is the weight of the solids and not of the liquid medium in which it is packed. The preparation yield factor for canned pears in the above table does not account for any further preparation that occurs prior to consumption. ",,,,,,
