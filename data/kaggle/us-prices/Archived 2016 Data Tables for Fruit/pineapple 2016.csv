"1The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) reports that inedible core, crown, and parings account for 49 percent of the retail weight, implying a preparation yield of 51 percent, when pineapple is eaten raw.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
2Consumers are assumed to eat the solid fruit and drink the juice. All contents of the can are edible and count towards an individual's recommended fruit consumption.   ,,,,,,,,

"3The syrup (or water) is discarded prior to consumption. Based on the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), ERS assumes that 65 percent of the can's gross weight is solid and 35 percent is liquid. The FPED cup equivalent weight for canned fruit is the weight of the solids and not of the liquid medium in which it is packed. The preparation yield factor for canned pineapple in the above table does not account for any further preparation that occurs prior to consumption.",,,,,,,,
